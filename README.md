# Reverse an Array
print the reverse of an array without using reverse

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
We took the aproach of making a for loop iterating over the length of the array that take the value of i and places it at index 0, and then grabs the rest of the array.

# Array Shift
Add a value to the middle of an array

## Challenge
Write a function called add_to_middle which takes in an array and a value. Without using build it language methods, return an array with the value inserted to the middle of the array

## Approach & Efficiency
We took the aproach of deviding the length of the array in half, and then using slice to add together the first half of the array, then the value, then the second half of the array

# Array Binary Search
Search an array for a value, return the index of that value in the array if matches

## Challenge
Write a function called binary_search that takes in a sorted array and the search key. Returns the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
We took the approach of making a function, then making a for loop set to the length of the array. We had a variable named i that was set at 0, if the search value matched the item in the list, it returns that value of i, if not i goes up by 1 and it checks the next thing on the list. If none of the items in the list match, it returns -1 instead.

# linked-list
Create classes for Node and Linked-List that can add a node to the begining of the linked list.
Create methods for linked-list that can add before and after a given value, and append to the end of the list.
create a method for linked-list that can tell you the value at a length from the end of the list

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created. Create an insert, includes and toString method

## Approach & Efficiency
We took the approach of making a Node class that take in a value. Then made a linked-list class that has methods to add nodes to the linked list, check the linked list to see if a value is already inside it, and can print the linked list in the form of a string.
